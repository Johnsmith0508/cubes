How To Run
----------
requires:
`npm` & `node.js`

To begin: `npm install`
to install all required libraries.
Then `node main.js` to start the server. Now, just point your browser to `loacalhost:3000` to see your wonderful game.

Configuration
-------------
The only current configuration is to change the environment variable `PORT` to the port that you want the server to listen on.

Note About Versioning
---------------------
Semantic versioning is overrated.
instead, the version `x.y.z` can be read as `major.minor.build`, where `build` is the build number from Heroku.
this makes it much easier to find the version you want on Heroku
